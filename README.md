MyQ Unattended Coding Test Cleaning Robot

=================================================================================

*The project was developed in C# Console Application - Visual Studio Community 2017.

*For the program to work correctly, the json file (source.json) must be in the same directory as the solution.

*The final json file (result.json) will be generated in the same directory as the solution.

*I recommend running the program by Visual Studio Community 2017.

*The file "source.json" must be in the same format as the example in the test.
